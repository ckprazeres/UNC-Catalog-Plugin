# UNC Catalog Plugin
Plugin that allows you to pull in course information, department information, or any page information from the official [UNC Catalog website](http://catalog.unc.edu).

This plugin uses forward proxy to get through security firewall, so it won't work on local development. See comments in the `catalog_get_xml` function.
